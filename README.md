## 🔷 Overview

The Hutchins Laws of Conscious Creation define the cognitive architecture behind elite creation.  
These are not productivity frameworks — they are foundational laws that govern how the world’s top developers, designers, strategists, and systems thinkers create at a high level.

The laws:
- Codify internal simulation as the first phase of all meaningful creation.
- Distinguish between deliberate mental creation and reactive development.
- Offer a teachable, scalable framework for mastery in conscious design.
